# Regression Models

The track is focused on providing three things: 

1. an introduction to the key ideas behind working with data in a scientific way that will produce new and reproducible insight, 

2. an introduction to the tools that will allow you to execute on a data analytic strategy, from raw data in a database to a completed report with interactive graphics, and 

3. on giving you plenty of hands on practice so you can learn the techniques for yourself.

Regression Models represents a both fundamental and foundational component of the series, and it presents the single most practical data analysis toolset.
